# Hydro Harvesters 🌱

Hydro Harvesters is a soilless farming innovation built to empower farmers and urban users with affordable, high-yield crop production. By combining hydroponics, automation, solar energy, and nutrient management, this project brings sustainability and tech together.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Farmers face low yields and poor-quality crops due to traditional farming methods, while consumers pay high prices for organic vegetables. Hydro Harvesters bridges this gap by providing:
- Higher yields (up to 7x)
- Automated nutrient and water cycles
- Solar-powered solutions
- Direct farmer-to-consumer channels

## 🚀 Key Features

- Soilless farming using hydroponic channels
- Automation using NodeMCU and sensors for nutrient/water flow
- Solar integration for energy independence
- Mobile-based monitoring system (coming soon)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Hardware**: NodeMCU, relay module, water pumps, sensors
- **Automation**: Arduino IDE, Blynk app
- **Power**: Solar panel setup
- **Web**: React + Express (in progress for product info and online orders)

## 📦 How to Run

1. Connect the NodeMCU to WiFi via Blynk app.
2. Load the Arduino code from `main.ino`.
3. Set up water and nutrient channels with sensors.
4. Solar panel powers pumps and controller.
5. Monitor the system via Blynk or terminal.
